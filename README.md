# Ascending-a-Tree
Given a Binary Tree structure with weights assigned to each node in the tree, write a function that returns the node weights in Ascending order.

eg: f({
    weight: 2,
    children: [{
          weight: 4,
          children: []
    },{
          weight: 3,
          children: []
    }]
}) => [2,3,4]
